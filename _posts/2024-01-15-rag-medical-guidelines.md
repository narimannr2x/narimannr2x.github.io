Medical guidelines are essential — but juggling dozens of complex, sometimes conflicting documents in real time? Not easy.

We’re building a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system to fix that. Here's what we're doing:

### The Problem:

- Tons of guidelines, constant updates.
    
- Conflicting recommendations across sources.
    
- Hard to access in the rush of clinical work.
    

### Our Solution:

- **Document Processing:** Smart parsing, semantic chunking, metadata tagging.
    
- **Knowledge Base:** Embedded guideline sections, version tracking, mapping relationships.
    
- **Retrieval Engine:** Context-aware queries, relevance scoring, evidence-level awareness.
    

### What It Can Do:

- **Compare guidelines** side-by-side (e.g., ADA vs EASD on Type 2 Diabetes).
    
- **Synthesize evidence** across sources.
    
- **Support real-time decisions** at the bedside.
    

### What We Learned:

- Chunk size matters for keeping medical meaning intact.
    
- Fine-tuning embeddings on medical data massively improves retrieval.
    
- Query reformulation boosts relevance (especially for complex cases).
    

### The Impact:

- Faster access to the right info.
    
- More consistent, evidence-based decisions.
    
- A practical tool for clinicians and a great training aid for new doctors.
    

### What's Next:

- Real-time updates, EHR integration, specialty expansion — and making it even more patient-specific.

**In short:** We're making it way easier for doctors to actually _use_ the best evidence at the right moment — without replacing the human touch.
